# Leafs Rolodex

A fun React application where users can sort through roster information about the best/worst team in the NHL, the Toronto Maple Leafs. Users can view stats and add tags to individual players, as well as search players by tag and name.


The data used in this application is provided by the [NHL Stats API](https://statsapi.web.nhl.com/api/v1/teams/), with help from its [unofficial documentation.](https://gitlab.com/dword4/nhlapi)

### Future Improvements


Currently, when a user adds a tag to a player, the tag is not saved in memory when the page is refreshed. Future versions of the app will have stronger data storage for such details.


For people who remember what a real-life rolodex looked like, the CSS for this app will eventually be upgraded to replicate the feel of a rolodex on the screen. 


*This application was initially inspired by the [Hatchways.io](https://www.hatchways.io/) 
front-end assessment.*
